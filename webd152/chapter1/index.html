    <p>My favorite thing to drink would be green tea with a little bit of honey. 
    While green tea on its own tastes delicious enough, the honey adds a bit of sweetness to the picture, which is rarely a downside. Not to mention the health benefits of green tea as well, as it can improve brain function and lower the risk of heart disease, making it a great mix of healthy and tasty.
